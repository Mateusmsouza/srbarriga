## Using Sr Barriga

Sr Barriga is an automation for splitting streamming servicesâ€™s bill and notify about it monthly.

It runs a job using Github Actions and fires a script to send a message on a Telegram Group to remember people how much and when they should pay.

That means you donâ€™t have to remember nor ask people to pay you by your Netflix or Disney +, Sr Barriga will take care for you ðŸ˜Š.

Currently supported features are:

- Charge monthly;
- Payment register script;
- Sends message on Telegram to remember the group.
